        At Micro Services, Inc. we believe that developing and managing code for the cloud has become too complex. We want to
        strip away all the excess and help developers refocus on building products not the plumbing.<br><br>Weâ€™re building M3O
        (pronounced "em-three-oh"); a new cloud platform for Micro services development. A fully managed service which enables 
        developers to focus on writing code rather than managing the infrastructure. Help us build it.
